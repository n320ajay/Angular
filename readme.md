We know simple factorial computations cause overflow very soon. Therefore, we use factorials of large numbers. 
One simple solution is to generate all Fibonacci numbers one by one and compute factorial of every generated number using method discussed in factorials of large numbers
An efficient solution is based on the fact that Fibonacci numbers are increasing in order. So we use the previously generated factorial to compute next factoria
